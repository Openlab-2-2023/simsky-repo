            <p>Darth Vader, formerly known as <i>Anakin Skywalker</i>, is a Sith Lord with decades of experience in
                galactic domination, leading Imperial forces, and wielding the Dark Side of the Force. Known for his
                exceptional leadership and strong negotiation skills—often utilizing a "persuasive" Force choke—he’s
                helped build the Galactic Empire into a (mostly) functioning tyranny.</p>
